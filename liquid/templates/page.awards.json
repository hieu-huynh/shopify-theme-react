Many testing facilities use a test person and a test machine to measure how far the body sinks into the surface of the mattress and how well it keeps the sleepers spine aligned. A good mattress should keep your spine parallel to the surface and shouldn’t allow your body to sink in too deeply. To test how well the mattress isolates motion a large, stamp-like device applies pressure to one area of the mattress. If the mattress only compresses where the pressure was applied, then you won’t be disturbed by your partner tossing and turning next to you.<\/p>"}},"60dac8f6-ac52-4e03-a173-a957e6962b58":{"type":"slide","settings":{"question":"Ease of Use","answer":"<p>Though most mattresses nowadays don’t need to be flipped, turning it once every three months helps keep the mattress in good condition and can increase its lifespan. In the ease of use category, testing agencies assess whether a mattress has handles, how heavy it is and how easy it is to turn. They also take a closer look at the structure of the mattress: It shouldn't be too soft, so that it bends when you pick it up, and it shouldn’t be too rigid that you cannot move it at all. Generally, if the mattress can be turned by one person it will receive a positive score in this category.<\/p>"}},"7d36cf2a-79a8-4521-a36d-22e483c66e0b":{"type":"slide","settings":{"question":"Durability","answer":"<p>When you invest in a mattress, you want it to last as long as possible without the feel of it changing, it sagging or the supportive properties suffering. In order to test how durable a mattress is, a test machine is used: Heavy barrels are rolled across the mattress over and over again, simulating 10 years of use. Ideally, the firmness of the mattress should not have changed significantly, and the foams should not have sagged or became damaged during the testing process.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["c1003eec-4aaa-47ac-8502-579380585174","60dac8f6-ac52-4e03-a173-a957e6962b58","7d36cf2a-79a8-4521-a36d-22e483c66e0b"],"settings":{}}},"order":["main","accordion"]}
